1
The sun was dipping below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the dense jungle.
2
Amara tightened the straps of her backpack and glanced at the old map in her hands.
3
“Eryndor should be just beyond this ridge,” she murmured.
4
Her guide, Tariq, nodded silently, eyes scanning the thick undergrowth ahead.
5
They had been trekking for days, following legends of a lost city buried beneath centuries of vines and earth.
6
Amara’s heart pounded with excitement—and fear.
7
“The stories say the city holds treasures beyond imagination,” Tariq said quietly.
8
“But also curses,” Amara replied, recalling the warnings from the village elders.
9
As they climbed higher, the jungle grew eerily silent.
10
The usual chorus of birds and insects had vanished.
11
Amara’s grip tightened on her machete.
12
Suddenly, a low rumble echoed through the trees.
13
The ground trembled beneath their feet.
14
“Earthquake?” Tariq whispered, stepping carefully.
15
Then the earth cracked open ahead of them, revealing a deep chasm.
16
“It’s the entrance!” Amara exclaimed.
17
Below, stone steps spiraled downward into darkness.
18
Lighting her torch, Amara led the way down the ancient stairway.
19
The air grew cooler, thick with the scent of damp stone and moss.
20
Faint carvings lined the walls, depicting scenes of an ancient civilization.
21
A figure with outstretched arms, surrounded by stars and swirling symbols, caught Amara’s eye.
22
“Look at this,” she said, tracing the symbols.
23
Tariq studied it. “This might be a map or a warning.”
24
They pressed forward, deeper into the labyrinth.
25
Shadows flickered as their torchlight danced across crumbled pillars and fallen statues.
26
A sudden noise—like footsteps—echoed behind them.
27
Amara spun around, but saw nothing but darkness.
28
“Stay close,” she said, gripping Tariq’s arm.
29
They continued cautiously until they reached a vast chamber.
30
At its center stood an enormous stone altar covered in dust and strange glyphs.
31
Amara approached, brushing away the debris.
32
Engraved on the altar was a riddle:
33
“Only those who bear the light of truth shall awaken the guardian.”
34
“What does that mean?” Tariq asked, eyes narrowing.
35
Amara thought for a moment. “Maybe the torch isn’t just for seeing.”
36
She raised the flame to the altar.
37
Suddenly, the ground shook again.
38
From the shadows emerged a massive stone guardian—half man, half beast.
39
Its eyes glowed with an otherworldly light.
40
Tariq gasped, stepping back.
41
Amara stood her ground.
42
“Guardian of Eryndor,” she said calmly.
43
“I seek only knowledge and safe passage.”
44
The guardian tilted its head, then stepped aside, revealing a hidden doorway.
45
Beyond lay a treasure chamber filled with gold, jewels, and ancient artifacts.
46
But Amara’s eyes were drawn to a glowing orb at the center.
47
As she reached out, visions flooded her mind—histories of the lost civilization, their rise and fall.
48
The orb was not just treasure, but a source of knowledge.
49
“Take only what you can understand,” the guardian’s voice echoed.
50
Amara nodded, feeling the weight of responsibility.
51
They gathered what they could carry, careful not to disturb the delicate balance.
52
As they retraced their steps, the guardian followed silently.
53
Outside, the jungle had come alive again—the birds singing, the wind whispering.
54
Amara smiled.
55
The lost city was no longer forgotten.
56
And she had a story the world needed to hear.
